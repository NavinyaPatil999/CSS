        <h3>Usage of box model</h3>
        <p>The CSS box model is the foundation of how elements are displayed and spaced on a web page. Think of every
            HTML element as a rectangular box, and this model defines what’s inside and around that box. It consists of
            four main parts, from the inside out:
            <br><br>
            <img src="./satoru.jpg" alt="satoru" width="250px" height="150px" style="border: 1px solid black; border-radius: 20px;">
            <br></p>
            <p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
            <l><b>Content</b>:This is where your text, images, or other content lives.
            </l><br>
            <l><b>Padding:</b>Clears space inside the element, around the content. It’s transparent.
            </l><br>
            <l><b>Border</b>:A visible line that wraps around the padding and content.
            </l><br>
            <l><b>Margin:</b>Clears space outside the element, separating it from other elements. Also transparent.
            </l><br>
        </ol>

            CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a styling language used to enhance the appearance of web pages by controlling the layout, colors, fonts, and spacing of HTML elements. It allows developers to create visually appealing and responsive designs by using various styling rules and techniques. The fundamental concepts in CSS include selectors, which target specific elements, and the box model, which defines the spacing and layout of elements using margins, borders, padding, and content. Advanced features like Flexbox and Grid help in creating structured and adaptable designs, while positioning allows precise control over element placement. Typography ensures readability through font styles, sizes, and spacing, and colors & backgrounds enhance aesthetics with gradients and images. CSS also enables interactive effects using animations & transitions, making websites more engaging. Media queries are crucial for responsive design, ensuring pages look great on different screen sizes. Additionally, pseudo-classes & pseudo-elements allow dynamic styling, and CSS variables help maintain consistency across designs. By mastering these topics, developers can craft compelling user experiences that are both functional and visually appealing.
